            </p>
            <p id="text_main">Even if youve never used Present before, youâ€™ll nd creating a presentation surprisingly simple. It all starts
                with an enhanced Theme Chooser that lets you preview an impressive collection of 44 Apple-designed
                themes. Drag across a theme to skim through its slide designs. Once youve chosen the perfect canvas for
                your presentation, simply substitute your own words and images for the placeholder text and graphics.
                Thanks to the Slide Navigator, the progress of your presentation and its organization are always in
                view.Easy-to-use tools let you add elements such as tables, charts, media, and shapes to your slides. Add a
                table with a click. Just as easily add a 3D chart that you can animate. With the Media Browser, you can drag
                and drop photos from your Photo libraries, movies from your Movies folder, and music from your iTunes
                library.</p>

            <p id="texxt1">Easy to look

            </p>
            <p id="text_main">Make each slide in your presentation look its absolute best using the powerful graphics tools built
                into Present. Quickly and cleanly remove the background of an image using the Instant Alpha tool. Or
                mask it within a predrawn shape, such as a circle or
                a star. With alignment and spacing guides, you can
                easily nd the center of the slide and see if objects are spaced evenly. So anything you add to
                your slides â€” graphics, images, text boxes, or shapes is placed precisely where you want it. If
                youâ€™re adding a owchart or a diagram to your slide, then youâ€™ll appreciate the connection lines feature. Connection lines between two objects remain anchored, no matter what
                changes you make. Move the objects around, and the lines move with them. </p>

              <p>  With your choice of more than 50 transitions, including 3D transitions, youre sure to keep their eyes riveted
                to the screen as you move from one slide to the next. Apply the Magic Move transition and a repeated object,
                such as your companys logo, automatically changes location, scale, opacity, and rotation across consecutive
                slides. Text and object animations are a compelling way to punctuate your message. Morph text on one slide
                into text on the next slide. Build your slide one bullet point, table row, or chart series at a time. Or have it all
                appear at once, entering stage left or spinning onto the screen. You can ne-tune your animations by setting
                the duration, choosing which element is aected rst, and dening the animation path along a straight line
                or a curve.

        <p><b>  Your own show.

        <p>Keep the pace of your presentation owing smoothly with the Presenter Display feature. While your presentation appears on the main display for your audience, you can see the current and next slides, your slide
            notes, a clock, and a timer on a second display. Cant be there to present in person? The show can still go on.
            Using the built-in narration tool, Present captures your audio voiceover and timing as you step through
            builds or move from one slide to the next.</p>
