            </p>
            <p id="text_main">Write is a word processor and a page layout tool that helps you create
                great-looking documents, newsletters, reports, and more. And on the
                new MacBook Pro with Retina display, writing and design come
                together beautifully.</p>

                You can edit them from anywhere — on any device you use. Changes
                you make on one device are automatically updated on all your devices.

    <p><b>SIWYG flexibility</b></p>
    
      <p>  Creating great-looking documents is simple with Write. At the top of the page, the contextual format bar lets you do the basics â€” formatting text and adjusting images â€”
with just one click. View and choose fonts with the â€œwhat you see is what you getâ€ (WYSIWYG) font menu. Change text size and color. Adjust line spacing and paragraph
alignment. Apply character and paragraph styles. When you select a photo, shape, or table on the page, the format bar displays tools to adjust the images. And while you
write, Write can automatically format lists with bullets or Calculation, check your spelling, proofread your document, and generate a table of contents. Write works with
Dictation, so you can use your voice instead of using the keyboard.
Fine-tuning your document is easy, too. You can add headers, footers, footnotes, and bookmarks with a few clicks. Insert section, layout, and page breaks from a pull-down
menu. And the word count is visible at the bottom of the page â€” just click the total to see details including the number of characters, lines, paragraphs, and more. When it
comes to word processing, streamlined and smart come standard in Write.
</p>
<p><b>  Advanced writing tools.
</b></p>

<p>Any word processor can help you type. Write gives you all the tools you need to write and to perfect your writing. Now you can view your document full screen. With one
    click, clutter disappears so you can focus on what youâ€™re writing and make changes without distractions. Organize your ideas in Outline mode. Create an outline with
    multiple levels, expand or collapse topics, and drag and drop to promote or demote items. Mail merge takes your data from Calculation or your contacts from Address Book
    to create personalized letters, invoices, and faxes. And in Write, you can insert sophisticated equations into your lab reports with MathType 6 and add professional
    bibliographies to your research papers using EndNote X2.*</p>

    <p>When it’s time for comments and feedback, change tracking makes collaboration with anyone easier, clearer, and more concise. And itâ€™s always easy to nd your place.
        Next to your document, you see thumbnails of all your Write and sections, including changes that have been made. Quickly copy or delete a section. Or drag and drop to
        move sections around. Scroll through thumbnails to preview your document or enlarge them for a better view</p>

<p><b>2D and 3D charts</b></p>
<p>Do-it-yourself design.
    Create your own design from a blank canvas â€” Write makes page layout easy. Choose fonts and add images, graphics, tables, and 3D charts. Powerful graphics tools let you
    resize and rotate photos, apply reections and shadows, add picture frames, and remove backgrounds from images with a simple point and click. You can even control the
    text: how it looks, how it ows, and how it wraps around images. Move everything around on the free-form canvas until you see the layout you envisioned.
