            <p id="text_main1">In Calculation, spreadsheets are built on a
                flexible, free-form canvas. So you can move
                tables, charts, graphics, and text anywhere you
                want on the page. As tables resize, objects
                automatically adjust to t around them. Create
                as many tables as you want. Change fonts, sizes,
                colors, styles, and borders. With graphics tools,
                alignment guides, and rulers,
                spreadsheet-making becomes a surprisingly
                creative endeavor. And suddenly, spreadsheets
                make more sense.

                    you can choose from over 300. Tooltips and built-in help provide clear and concise explanations of each
                    variable. The Formula List view shows you every calculation on your spreadsheet at once. And with a few
                    clicks on the toolbar, you can create tables and charts and add images and graphics. Easily nd fonts and

                <p id="text_main">Calculation is a blank canvas for tables. You can create as many as you want and resize them as needed. The layout of each
                    table is independent, so whatever you do to one table wonâ€™t aect the others. Move tables anywhere â€” even to a dierent
                    sheet â€” and the calculations remain intact. You can also share content between tables. WIth intuitive tools, Calculation helps
                    you analyze data. Enter data and change values within the cells and use sliders, checkboxes, steppers, and pop-up lists to
                    explore the results. With every change, formulas and charts instantly update and give you a new data scenario.
                   <br>
                    When thereâ€™s almost too much data to decipher, Calculation lets you create categories based on information from any
                    column. It automatically generates a summary row for each category. By using just the summary row, you can collapse,
                    expand, and rearrange categories to organize your data any way you want. The Reorganize button in the toolbar lets you lter
                    by category and gives you other advanced sorting and ltering options.
